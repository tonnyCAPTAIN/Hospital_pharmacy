# Hospital_pharmacy
An analysis of health sector for  5 counties in kenya 


# Hospital and Pharmacy Report

## Executive Summary

This interactive dashboard analyzes healthcare delivery and pharmacy utilization across six counties in Kenya: **Kiambu**, **Kisumu**, **Mombasa**, **Uasin Gishu**, **Nakuru**, and **Nairobi**.

The data model is built from three linked tables:
- **Patients**
- **Visits**
- **Pharmacy_Transactions**

These tables are connected via foreign keys for seamless analysis.

### Core Dashboard Sections and KPIs
- KPI Cards: Total visits, total pharmacy revenue, and average length of stay
- Disease trends over time
- Pharmacy cost breakdown by drug category
- County and department comparisons
- Slicers: County, diagnosis, and date range

## Key Findings

### County vs. Disease Hotspots
Flu, typhoid, and diabetes are the leading diagnoses across the counties, driven by high volumes of hospital visits.  
**Kiambu** and **Uasin Gishu** recorded the highest patient visit numbers and correspondingly high pharmacy revenue, marking them as priority areas.

### Revenue Distribution by Department
Pharmacy revenue is dominated by:
- **Inpatient** services: 7.9K (largest share)
- **Outpatient** services: 6.2K
- **Emergency** services: 2.0K (distant third)

This pattern underscores inpatient stays as the primary driver of medication-related costs.

### Age-Based Medication Consumption Trends
Older age categories showed higher medication usage. **Classes E (61–75)** and **F(76+)** consume more drugs per patient compared to younger ones (Classes A–C)..



**Pneumonia** cases exhibit longer average hospital stays while incurring lower pharmacy cost of approximately 95K. This pattern may reflect resource-intensive supportive care. The dashboard reveals a system where chronic and infectious diseases dominate workload, with older patients and select counties driving the majority of pharmacy revenue. 

## Opportunities & Recommendations
- Strengthen **preventive care** programs targeting top diagnoses (flu, typhoid, diabetes) to reduce visit volumes.
- Optimize **inpatient pharmacy protocols**, particularly for conditions like pneumonia, to improve cost efficiency without compromising care quality.
- Prioritize **supply chain and resource planning** in high-volume counties (e.g., Kiambu and Uasin Gishu) to ensure medication availability and cost control.

This analysis provides actionable insights for resource allocation, preventive strategies, and operational improvements in healthcare and pharmacy sectors.
